## ✨ Why it Matters
- ⚡ **Higher Utilization** – Vehicles are allocated where they are needed most.  
- 💰 **Increased Profits** – Reduce downtime and operational costs.  
- 🙂 **Customer Satisfaction** – Faster, smarter response to demand.  

---

## 🔗 Data Sources & APIs
- 🗺️ **Maps**: Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap (routing & traffic)  
- ☁️ **Weather**: OpenWeather API (real-time weather impact)  
- 📈 **Demand**: Simulated demand datasets (to test allocation strategies)  

---

## 🎯 Prototype Goal
The prototype demonstrates:  
- Simulation of live conditions (traffic, weather, demand).  
- AI agents making **optimal fleet allocation decisions**.  
- Visualization of results (heatmaps, ETAs, demand surges).
